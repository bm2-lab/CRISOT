## Introduction

The powerful CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system is hindered by its off-target effects. Although in silico tools have been developed for single-strand guide RNA (sgRNA) design and CRISPR off-target evaluation, the genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction performance is limited. In this study, we proposed that the modelling of molecular interactions within the Cas9-sgRNA-DNA complex can substantially improve the genome-wide off-target prediction. To this end, we systematically performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to capture the molecular interaction features of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. CRISOT, which is a powerful tool package suite that contains various modules for genome-wide CRISPR off-target evaluation and sgRNA optimization, is presented.

In the CRISOT suite, CRISOT-FP was designed as the fingerprint of an sgRNA-DNA pair encoded by molecular interaction features, and an XGBoost (XGB) model trained with CRISOT-FP surpassed the state-of-the-art off-target prediction methods. Furthermore, CRISOT-Score was designed by using key interaction features identified from CRISOT-FP and has obtained great results in scoring off-target sites and distinguishing active off-targets from inactive ones. Then, CRISOT-Spec was designed to intuitively evaluate the off-target specificity of an sgRNA. Finally, CRISOT-Opti was designed for sgRNA optimization by ingeniously introducing a mutation to the sgRNA to reduce the off-target effect while maintaining efficient on-target effect.

* **CRISOT-FP**: Molecular interaction fingerprint for developing prediction models for CRISPR off-target effects. Users can use the trained models in [models](models) to predict CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects.
* **CRISOT-Score**: Key interaction features were derived to develop CRISOT-Score, an efficient off-target scoring function to evaluate off-target effects.
* **CRISOT-Spec**: CRISOT-Spec is used to evaluate the off-target specificity of a given sgRNA.
* **CRISOT-Opti**: CRISOT-Opti is used for sgRNA optimization, which smartly introduces a single nucleotide mutation for the given sgRNA by reducing the off-target effect of the given sgRNA while maintaining its on-target effect.

Collectively, the CRISOT suite provides an accurate and comprehensive evaluation of genome-wide CRISPR off-target effects, as well as an efficient way to optimize a given sgRNA for improved off-target specificity in CRISPR genome editing.

### score

Calculates the CRISOT-Score score of a given pair of sgRNA-DNA, e.g.,

```bash

python CRISOT.py score --sgr GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAANGG --tar GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAANGG

# output:
CRISOT-Score: 
0.9473928688501404
```

```bash

python CRISOT.py score --sgr GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAANGG --tar GAGTCCGAGGAGAAGACGAAGGG

# output:
CRISOT-Score: 
0.6892195294509914

```

NOTE: sgRNA and target sequences should be 23-nt, with NGG PAM.

### scores

Calculates CRISOT-Score scores of a series of sgRNA-DNA sequences in a csv file, e.g.,

```bash

python CRISOT.py scores --csv example/example.csv --out example/CRISOT-Score_example_out.csv

# output CRISOT-Score scores in file example/CRISOT-Score_example_out.csv

```

NOTE: The default column names of the input csv file are 'On' and 'Off' for sgRNA and target DNA sequences, respectively.

### spec

Given a series of off-target sequences of a specific sgRNA, *spec* calculates the CRISOT-Spec score, e.g.,

```bash

python CRISOT.py spec --csv example/example.csv

# output:
CRISOT-Spec: 
0.8296024039222938

```

NOTE: Off-target sequences in the csv file should be of the same sgRNA. On-target sequence must be in the first line.

### off_spec

Given an sgRNA and its on-target sequence, *off_spec* searches for the genome-wide off-target sites and calculates the CRISOT-Spec score, e.g.,

```bash

python CRISOT.py off_spec --sgr GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAANGG --tar GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAAGGG --genome data/test_genome.fa

# output:
CRISOT-Spec: 
0.912578202248319

```

NOTE: 1. Use the proper genome reference file. 2. Change the *--dev* if CUDA error occurs.
